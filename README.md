# Dark MessageBox
This is just example of MessageBox using C# forms. Took me 2 hours to make it. This is just a small projects that I've made. If you wondered why there is resize, yeah I don't know why. Maybe it was VS bugs... I already set it to **GrowAndShrink**.

<h3>Requirement</h3>
- Visual Studio 2019
